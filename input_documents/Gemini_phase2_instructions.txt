For phase 2, I intend to build on the solution architecture behind boardy. After the scout identifies target companies, it should reach out to them (cold calls, whatsapp, emails, linkedin and any other channel available to them - X, reddit, etc.) to share it's insights. The solution should handle clarification questions and collaborate with the founder to jointly identify and implement potential solutions to their GTM issues, including connecting to internal data repositories and systems to gain more meaningful insights and more accurately prescribe the problems. The solution should include limits and other paywalls that enable us to offer premium subscriptions to founders that see value from the solution
