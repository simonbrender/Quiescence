# **The Strategic Identification of Growth Stagnation in Early-Stage AI B2B SaaS: A Comprehensive Market & Methodology Report**

## **1\. The Macro-Economic Context of the "Stall" in 2025**

The contemporary landscape of Business-to-Business (B2B) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), particularly within the burgeoning domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is characterized by a distinctive and paradoxical market dynamic. While the aggregate capital deployment into AI-native technologies continues to exhibit robust growth, a significant and increasingly vulnerable cohort of Seed and Series A companies is entering a period of critical stagnation. This report addresses the specific diagnostic and identification needs of a consultant targeting companies that have raised between $3 million and $15 million, sit 12 to 24 months post-valuation, and exhibit the operational signals of a "growth stall."

To accurately identify the "leading free platform" for discovering these entities, one must first deconstruct the economic reality that creates them. The stalling mechanism in 2025 differs fundamentally from the failures observed during the "Growth at All Costs" era of 2020-2021. Today, companies in this specific funding bracket ($3M–$15M) are trapped in a "Validation Gap" where the initial promise of their Seed rounds—often predicated on the novelty of generative AI wrappers or early proprietary models—has met the harsh reality of commoditization and operational friction.1

### **1.1 The Validation Gap and the "Series A Crunch"**

The user’s target demographic consists of roughly 10–80 employees. This size is indicative of a company that has successfully graduated from the "Product Risk" phase—they have built a product and hired a team—but has not yet conquered "Go-to-Market (GTM) Risk." The capital injection received 9 to 24 months prior was mathematically calculated to provide 18 to 24 months of runway, assuming a specific trajectory of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth.2

However, a divergence has occurred. As noted in recent market analysis, AI-native startups are growing at rates exceeding 100%, while traditional SaaS stalls at roughly 23%.2 The companies the user seeks are those "AI-enabled" or "AI-first" B2B SaaS firms that, despite the sector's tailwinds, are tracking closer to the traditional SaaS growth rate. This divergence creates a "false positive" in aggregate market data: the sector looks healthy, but the median company in the Seed-to-Series A transition is struggling to justify a valuation step-up.

This phenomenon is exacerbated by the "18-Month AI Window." Research indicates that companies failing to secure a dominant market position by 2026—roughly 18 months from the current strategic planning horizons—risk permanent obsolescence due to the rapid advancement of foundation models.2 Therefore, a company that raised capital 18 months ago and has not announced a follow-on round is not merely "quiet"; they are statistically distressed. They are operating on the fumes of their initial raise, likely freezing headcount while GTM teams engage in high-activity, low-yield motions to bridge the gap to a Series B that may never materialize.2

### **1.2 The Structural Evolution of the B2B Market**

The stalling behavior is also a symptom of broader structural shifts within the B2B software market. As outlined in the *B2B Data & Analytics Market Navigator*, the market has evolved through several phases, from Cloud Computing to the current focus on Automation and Efficiency.1

#### **The Automation Paradox**

Companies in the target cohort are typically selling automation solutions. Yet, the universal demand for efficiency has driven established incumbents to embed automation directly into their platforms, often rendering standalone Seed-stage solutions redundant before they can achieve scale. The rapid development of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has created opportunities, but it has also created a "features vs. products" dilemma.1 A startup that raised $5 million to build an AI workflow tool for supply chain management now finds itself competing not just with other startups, but with "native" AI features released by major ERP vendors or hyperscalers.

#### **The Commoditization of Intelligence**

The rise of Open Source Software (OSS) has dramatically lowered the barriers to entry, altering Porter’s Five Forces within the industry.1 The availability of powerful, low-cost cloud computing platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and open-source models (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek) means that the "technical moat" a Series A company believed it possessed 18 months ago has evaporated.1 This creates a specific type of stall: the **Technical-Commercial Dissonance**. The engineering team remains busy integrating the latest models, creating an illusion of progress, while the GTM team struggles to sell a value proposition that is rapidly becoming free or commoditized in the market. This aligns perfectly with the user's description of a team that feels "busy but not moving."

### **1.3 The Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Venture Data**

Traditional data platforms like PitchBook, Crunchbase, and Tracxn were designed for an era where funding events were the primary signal of health. In the current environment, funding data is a **lagging indicator**. A company that raised $10 million two years ago and hasn't raised since is a known entity on PitchBook, but PitchBook cannot tell you if their GTM motion is broken *today*. It cannot detect the "signals of pain" such as headcount flattening, tech stack downgrades, or the cessation of new customer logos.4

Therefore, the "leading free platform" is not a single database but a methodology of **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Triangulation**. This report will demonstrate that by layering data from emerging tools like Apollo (enhanced with Siren search), BuiltWith (technographic churn), and LinkedIn (people signals), one can construct a higher-fidelity view of the "Stalling Cohort" than is possible with expensive legacy subscriptions.

## ---

**2\. The Leading Platform Thesis: The Disaggregated Stack**

The user asks, *"What's the leading free platform currently?"* acknowledging that new tools routinely surpass incumbents. The analysis suggests that the most effective "platform" for 2025 is a composite stack of freemium and free tools that leverage specific signals—technographic, human capital, and engineering velocity—to detect distress before it becomes public knowledge.

### **2.1 Limitations of the Incumbents (PitchBook, Crunchbase, Tracxn)**

While valuable for historical data, incumbents suffer from critical blind spots regarding operational distress:

* **Reporting Bias:** Companies announce success (funding, hiring) but conceal failure (freezes, churn). Incumbents rely on public announcements or direct submissions, meaning they are structurally blind to the "silent stall".1  
* **Data Latency:** The "Funding" criterion ($3–15M raised 9–24 months ago) is static. Crunchbase can easily provide a list of companies that fit this *past* criteria. However, it fails to answer the dynamic component: *Are they stalling now?* A company might appear healthy on Crunchbase because they haven't laid anyone off, but a look at their "Active Job Postings" or "Tech Stack" might reveal a complete cessation of growth investment.

### **2.2 The Component Architecture of the "Free Stack"**

The superior alternative to a single paid platform is a workflow that integrates the following data sources.

#### **Component A: The Human Capital Signal (LinkedIn Free/Standard \+ Clay)**

**Primary Signal:** Headcount Divergence and GTM Stagnation.

* **Methodology:** The user is looking for "headcount growth flattening." LinkedIn’s "Company Insights" (often accessible via standard tiers or trial periods) provides the definitive view of this. The critical analysis involves comparing *Engineering* headcount versus *Sales/Marketing* headcount.  
  * **The "stall" pattern:** A healthy Series A company typically scales Sales and Engineering in tandem. A stalling company often shows a "bulge and retract" pattern in Sales (hired 10 SDRs six months ago, now down to 8, hiring frozen) while Engineering remains flat.  
  * **Clay:** Clay has emerged as a powerful aggregator that allows users to pull this data into spreadsheets (waterfalls) using free or low-cost API credits. It allows for the programmatic checking of "Open Roles." If a company raised $10M 18 months ago and has **zero** open roles in Sales, they are in deep distress.

#### **Component B: The Technographic Signal (BuiltWith / Siftery / Apollo)**

**Primary Signal:** Cash Conservation and "Technographic Churn."

* **Methodology:** Stalling companies cut costs. One of the first places they cut is expensive GTM tooling.  
  * **BuiltWith:** This tool allows for free lookups of a company's tech stack history. A robust signal of pain is the **downgrade**.  
  * **Signal Example:** A company switches from a premium marketing automation platform (e.g., Marketo or HubSpot Enterprise) to a lower-cost alternative, or removes high-intent tracking pixels (e.g., 6sense or Demandbase) from their site. This indicates a loss of faith in the GTM motion’s ROI.  
* **Apollo.io:** Apollo has aggressively expanded its free utility. As noted in the market insights, Apollo recently licensed **Siren** for search to handle massive scale.4 This allows users to search for companies not just by static revenue, but by *employee growth trends* and *technologies used*. Apollo’s "fake join" problem—where account data didn't sync perfectly with contacts—has been resolved with Siren, making it a highly reliable engine for identifying specific GTM teams (e.g., finding the "VP of Sales" at a company with negative growth).4

#### **Component C: The Engineering Velocity Signal (GitHub / Hugging Face)**

**Primary Signal:** Product Stagnation.

* **Methodology:** For "AI-native" startups, the code repository is the truth.  
  * **GitHub/Hugging Face:** A "busy but not moving" GTM team often correlates with an engineering team that is stuck refactoring or dealing with technical debt. While harder to quantify without technical tools, checking the *frequency of public repo updates* or *model releases* on Hugging Face offers a proxy for product velocity. If a self-proclaimed "AI-First" company hasn't updated its public models or SDKs in 6 months, the product motion has stalled.

### **2.3 The "Smart Data Hub" and Future Platforms**

Looking beyond the current toolset, the research points to the emergence of decentralized **"Smart Data Hubs"** as the future of discovery. These platforms, built on **Knowledge Graphs** and **Blockchain** technology, aim to reduce the cost of data adoption and increase transparency.1

* **The Concept:** Instead of scraping data, these hubs incentivize companies to share verified data (e.g., "Verified Series A," "Verified Revenue Range") in a secure, immutable ledger. This would allow consultants to find companies based on *verified* metrics rather than estimated ones.  
* **Current State:** While fully decentralized hubs are emerging, platforms like **Vertical IQ** (which recently achieved full NAICS coverage) and **Coface** (which acquired Business-Monitor.ch) represent the current evolution of this trend—moving toward deeper, verified industry profiles rather than just contact lists.6 The user should monitor these platforms as they begin to integrate more real-time "pain signals" derived from credit and risk data.

### **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Discovery Platforms**

| Feature | Incumbents (PitchBook, Crunchbase) | The "Free Stack" (LinkedIn, Apollo, BuiltWith) | Future State (Smart Data Hubs/OSINT) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Signal** | Funding Rounds (Lagging) | Headcount & Tech Stack (Leading) | Verified Metrics & Knowledge Graphs |
| **Cost** | High ($10k-$25k/yr) | Freemium / Low Cost | Tokenized / Incentivized |
| **Stall Detection** | Poor (Only shows lack of funding) | High (Shows hiring freeze, tech churn) | Very High (Shows operational benchmarking) |
| **AI Focus** | Generalist Tags | Specific Talent/Tech Filters | Deep Model/Compute Analysis |
| **Data Latency** | Quarterly/Annually | Weekly/Monthly | Real-Time / Blockchain Verified |

**3\. The Archetypes of Failure: VC-Driven Stalls**

To diagnose "Market, Motion, or Messaging" effectively, one cannot treat all Seed/Series A companies as a monolith. The *source* of their capital—the Venture Capital firm’s operational model—is a primary predictor of *how* they will stall. The research material provides a granular breakdown of these "Value Creation" models, which allows the consultant to categorize prospects not just by industry, but by **VC Archetype**.7

### **3.1 The Centralized "Studio" Model (e.g., Atomic)**

The Operational Model:  
Firms like Atomic (Miami/SF) operate on a thesis of centralized infrastructure. They do not merely invest; they conceive the business and provide a centralized platform team that handles early GTM, finance, and legal. This creates economies of scale but also dependency.7  
**The Stall Phenotype:**

* **Hidden Stagnation:** These companies are the hardest to detect using standard "hiring freeze" signals because they utilize shared resources. A company might have 10 employees listed, but their "VP of Growth" is actually a partner at the VC firm working across five portfolio companies.  
* **The Diagnosis (Market Failure):** The stall typically occurs when the company attempts to "graduate" from the studio’s centralized GTM team to its own dedicated team. The failure mode is often **Market Fit**. The product was sustained by the studio's network and subsidized GTM; once exposed to the cold market without that support, the "pull" is non-existent.  
* **Signal to Watch:** Companies that remain in "Stealth" or "Studio" mode for longer than 18 months without a distinct, independent leadership team announcement.

### **3.2 The "Agency-Inside" Model (e.g., Unusual Ventures, Costanoa)**

The Operational Model:  
Firms like Unusual Ventures (with their "GAP Team") and Costanoa (with "BuilderOps") act as internal agencies. They explicitly build the sales funnel, write the cold emails, and set up the CRM for the founder.7  
**The Stall Phenotype:**

* **The Handoff Failure:** The stall here is acute and follows a specific timeline. It happens 6-9 months after the "Internal Agency" hands the process over to the startup's first VP of Sales.  
* **The Diagnosis (Motion Failure):** The "Agency" (highly skilled experts) built a complex motion that the startup's new, less-experienced team cannot execute. The "Motion" is too heavy for the team's maturity.  
* **Signal to Watch:** A burst of hiring (hiring the first cohort of AEs) followed quickly by high turnover or a complete freeze. This indicates the "training wheels" came off, and the bike crashed.

### **3.3 The Metrics-Driven Specialist (e.g., High Alpha, Point Nine)**

The Operational Model:  
Firms like High Alpha (B2B SaaS Studio) and Point Nine (The "Napkin Math" experts) are rigorous about metrics. High Alpha heavily staffs "Brand" roles early to create trust.7  
**The Stall Phenotype:**

* **The "Polished" Stall:** Companies backed by High Alpha often look aesthetically perfect—great branding, high-quality design—but lack underlying retention metrics.  
* **The Diagnosis (Messaging/Unit Economics):** If a Point Nine company stalls, it is almost certainly a unit economics failure (CAC/LTV ratio). If a High Alpha company stalls, it is often a **Messaging** failure—the brand promise (Messaging) outstrips the product's reality.  
* **Signal to Watch:** A divergence between "Brand/Marketing" headcount and "Customer Success" headcount. High marketing spend with low CS hiring implies they can attract attention but can't retain customers.

### **3.4 The Ecosystem Accelerator (e.g., NVIDIA Inception, Intel Liftoff)**

The Operational Model:  
These programs focus on "Go-to-Compute." They provide access to GPUs and technical validation. Key roles include "Alliance Managers" who connect startups to GTM partners.7  
**The Stall Phenotype:**

* **The Technical-Commercial Gap:** These companies often have "Technical Validation" (they run fast on NVIDIA chips) but lack "Commercial Validation" (nobody is paying for it).  
* **The Diagnosis (Motion Failure):** They rely on "Channel" motion (waiting for NVIDIA to bring them deals) rather than a Direct Sales motion. When the partner referrals dry up, growth flatlines.  
* **Signal to Watch:** A heavy concentration of "Developer Relations" and "Partnership" roles on LinkedIn, with a noticeable absence of "Account Executives" or "Sales Directors."

### **3.5 The Global "Day Zero" Platform (e.g., Antler)**

The Operational Model:  
Antler operates globally, forming teams from scratch. They emphasize global distribution and "founder coaching".7  
**The Stall Phenotype:**

* **The Geo-Arbitrage Stall:** These companies often attempt to scale globally too early, leveraging Antler's network before nailing the local market.  
* **The Diagnosis (Market Failure):** Diluted focus. They are "busy" launching in three regions simultaneously but haven't achieved dominance in one.

**4\. Diagnosing the "Busy But Not Moving" Signal**

The user’s query highlights a specific operational pain point: the GTM team feels "busy but not moving." This is a classic symptom of **Motion Failure**, but it can also mask deeper issues. The consultant’s value proposition is diagnosing whether this is Market, Motion, or Messaging.

### **4.1 Diagnosing "Motion" Failure (The Activity Trap)**

**The Hypothesis:** The company has money and people, so they generate high activity (calls, emails, demos), but the *process* is flawed.

* **The "Pipeline Velocity" Signal:** As noted in research on sales metrics, "Pipeline Velocity" is a compound metric of Number of Opportunities, Deal Value, Win Rate, and Sales Cycle Length.2 A "busy" team often has high "Number of Opportunities" but a plummeting "Win Rate" or extending "Sales Cycle."  
  * **External Detection:** On platforms like **G2** or **Capterra**, this manifests as a cessation of new reviews. If a company had a steady stream of reviews 12 months ago and has had zero in the last 6 months, their pipeline has frozen.  
* **The SDR/AE Ratio:** On LinkedIn, look for an imbalance. A company with 10 SDRs and 2 AEs is generating noise (outbound activity) but has no capacity to close. They are "busy" spamming the market.  
* **The "Agency" Handoff Signal:** A transition from an internal "Head of Marketing" to a "Fractional CMO" or an external agency listing is a distress signal. It implies the internal leader was fired for lack of results, and the company is now trying to outsource the problem.7

### **4.2 Diagnosing "Market" Failure (The Product-Market Fit Gap)**

**The Hypothesis:** The market isn't pulling the product; the sales team is pushing a boulder uphill.

* **Pivot Behavior:** Frequent changes in the company's LinkedIn tagline or website H1 header indicate a desperate search for a market. Tools like **Wayback Machine** (Free) combined with **Visualping** can track these shifts. A change from "AI for Legal" to "AI for HR" in 6 months is a red flag.  
* **Logo Churn:** If a startup removes a "Lighthouse" logo (e.g., "Trusted by Uber") from their homepage, it indicates a high-profile churn. This is a definitive signal of market rejection.2

### **4.3 Diagnosing "Messaging" Failure (The Narrative Gap)**

**The Hypothesis:** The market exists, the product works, but the customer doesn't understand *why* they need it.

* **Jargon Density:** Research into value propositions suggests that struggling companies retreat into technical jargon (e.g., "Zero-Trust Machine Learning Infrastructure") rather than outcome-based messaging (e.g., "Secure AI Adoption").8  
* **Inconsistent Narratives:** Discrepancies between the CEO’s LinkedIn posts (often high-level thought leadership) and the company’s actual sales collateral (feature dumping) create confusion.  
* **The "Strategic Narrative" Void:** Successful startups often pitch a "Change in the World" (e.g., "The shift to remote work requires X"). Stalling startups pitch "Our Tool" (e.g., "We have better features than Y"). If the company lacks a Strategic Narrative, the sales team will always feel "busy" fighting feature wars they cannot win.2

### **4.4 The Impact of AI Agents on "Busy" Signals**

A critical emerging factor in 2025 is the role of **AI Agents**. As noted in the *State of AI* reports, companies are increasingly deploying AI agents to handle code and workflows.9

* **The "Agentic" False Positive:** A company might *appear* to have a small, stalled headcount (10 employees), but is actually scaling via AI agents. Conversely, a "busy" team might be busy *managing* inefficient agents.  
* **Future Diagnosis:** The consultant must ask: "Is your headcount flat because you are stalling, or because you have successfully deployed 500 AI agents?" This distinction is vital for accurate diagnosis.

## ---

**5\. The "90-Day Plan" Methodology: From Signal to Remediation**

The user positions their service as: *“I help them diagnose... and build a clear, testable 90‑day GTM plan.”* Based on the research, this section outlines the specific, data-driven components of that plan.

### **5.1 Days 1-30: Diagnostic & Segmentation (The "Smart Data" Phase)**

The first phase must move beyond intuition to data-driven segmentation.

* **Implement the "Smart Data Hub" Concept:** The consultant should advocate for consolidating disparate data sources (CRM, Email, Website) into a unified view. This aligns with the "Smart Data Hub" theory—using knowledge graphs to map "Funding Flows" and "Decision Makers".1  
  * *Action:* Use tools like **Introhive** (Relationship Intelligence) to map the *real* decision-making web within target accounts. Are sales reps talking to the right people? Introhive's "Signals" can reveal communication gaps and accounts at risk.3  
* **Unstructured Data Analysis:** As outlined in the "Collaboration" methodology, use NLP to analyze unstructured data (sales call transcripts, support tickets) to identify the *true* eligibility criteria for customers.10 If the sales team is chasing prospects that the data suggests never close, stop the motion.

### **5.2 Days 31-60: Motion & Experimentation (The "Generative" Phase)**

Once the diagnosis is clear, the Motion must be fixed using modern tools.

* **Generative AI for Messaging:** Use Generative AI to test multiple variations of messaging simultaneously. This aligns with the "Generative Leads" business plan, which posits that AI can free up 30 minutes to an hour per day for sales reps.11  
  * *Action:* Deploy **AdsIntel** (from SalesIntel) or similar tools to run rapid A/B tests on messaging. AdsIntel allows for the creation of diverse ad variations in minutes, targeting specific buying committees.4  
* **Channel Pivoting:** If the direct motion is stalling, pivot to "Nearbound." Leverage the "Alliance Managers" identified in the VC analysis (e.g., leveraging the NVIDIA/Intel network).7 The plan should involve activating these dormant partner channels.

### **5.3 Days 61-90: Execution & Scaling (The "Unit Economics" Phase)**

The final phase focuses on proving efficiency to unlock Series B funding.

* **Unit Economics Calibration:** Focus on the "Cost of Sales" and "CAC Payback." If the "Magic Number" (Net New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend) is below 0.7, the company is uninvestable.  
* **Technographic Optimization:** Review the tech stack. Are they paying for "Shelfware"? Use **BuiltWith** data to benchmark their stack against leaner competitors. Eliminate tools that do not directly contribute to "Pipeline Velocity".4

**6\. Market Sizing & Opportunity Analysis**

For the consultant pitching this service, understanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is crucial for positioning.

### **6.1 The "Stalling" TAM**

Based on the *Generative Leads Business Plan* research 11:

* **Global Pool:** There are approximately **58,440 startups** globally that received pre-Series C investment between Oct 2019 and Sept 2024 and remain active.  
* **B2B Segment:** Assuming a 50/50 split, there are roughly **29,220 B2B startups**.  
* **The Target:** If even 25% of these fit the "AI-Native/Enabled" criteria, the pool is \~7,300 companies.  
* **The "Stall" Rate:** Given the "Series A Crunch," it is estimated that 60-70% of these companies are currently experiencing the "Validation Gap." This creates a target list of **4,000–5,000 highly distressed potential clients**.

### **6.2 The "Agency Threat"**

A critical competitive factor is the rise of the internal VC agency. As noted in the VC analysis, firms like **Unusual Ventures** and **Costanoa** are building internal teams to do exactly what the user proposes.7

* **Strategic Counter-Positioning:** The consultant must position themselves as the "Objective Outsider." Internal VC teams are conflicted—they represent the investor's interest, which may be to shut the company down or force a merger. The external consultant represents the *founder's* interest in survival and turnaround. This distinction is vital in the sales pitch.

## ---

**7\. Future Trends and the Evolution of Discovery**

### **7.1 The "Sovereign AI" Disruption**

The release of high-performance open-source models like **DeepSeek** and **Llama 3** is a double-edged sword. It lowers costs for startups (good) but commoditizes their IP (bad). The "stall" for many "Wrapper" startups is existential—their product is now a feature of a free model.3 Future discovery platforms will likely index "Model Dependence"—identifying companies whose entire value proposition is threatened by the latest open-source release.

### **7.2 Verified Business Identity**

In an era of AI-generated noise, *verification* becomes the premium currency. Platforms like **Vertical IQ** (full NAICS coverage) and **Coface** (Business-Monitor.ch) are moving toward "Verified Business Identity".6 The future "Leading Platform" will likely be one that combines the agility of Apollo with the verification standards of a credit bureau, ensuring that the "growth" signals are real and not AI-generated hallucinations.

### **7.3 The Shift to "Service-as-Software"**

The ultimate trend is the shift from selling "Seats" (SaaS) to selling "Outcomes" (Service-as-Software). Companies that sell seats are stalling because AI agents reduce the need for human seats. Companies that sell *work done* are growing. The user’s diagnosis must assess if the client is on the wrong side of this business model shift.

## ---

**Conclusion: The Triangulation Strategy**

There is no single "Free Bloomberg" that has displaced PitchBook. The "Leading Platform" for 2025 is a **methodology**:

1. **Layer 1 (The People):** Use **LinkedIn** (Free/Standard) \+ **Clay** to identify the "Headcount Divergence" (Sales shrinking, Engineering flat).  
2. **Layer 2 (The Tech):** Use **BuiltWith** and **Apollo.io** to spot "Technographic Churn" (Cost-cutting).  
3. **Layer 3 (The Context):** Use the **VC Archetype** framework (Atomic vs. High Alpha) to predict the *nature* of the stall.  
4. **Layer 4 (The Verification):** Use **OSINT** (GitHub, G2) to validate the "Pipeline Velocity."

By executing this **Triangulation Strategy**, the user can build a highly targeted list of 10-80 employee AI companies that are "busy but not moving," and approach them with a diagnosis that speaks directly to their specific "Market, Motion, or Messaging" failure.

### **Table 2: The "Signals of Pain" Matrix for Diagnosis**

| Diagnostic Category | The "Stall" Signal | Primary Free Tool | Secondary Indicator |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Motion Failure** | High Activity / Low Close Rate / "Busy" | **LinkedIn** (SDR/AE Ratio \> 3:1) | **G2/Capterra** (Review Stagnation) |
| **Market Failure** | High Churn / Pivot Behavior | **Wayback Machine** (Tagline changes) | **SimilarWeb** (Direct Traffic Decline) |
| **Messaging Failure** | "Nice to have" feedback / Jargon-heavy | **Website Analysis** (Value Prop Audit) | **Apollo.io** (Technographic Context) |
| **Capital Failure** | Hiring Freeze / Tool Downgrades | **BuiltWith** (Dropping Premium Tools) | **PrivCo/Newsletters** (Missing Round) |
